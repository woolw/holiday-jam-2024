Rescue the moles from the hammers.
Clicking on a mole that peeks it's head above ground will lower it.
If you do this while a hammer is hovering above, your score will increase.
If your mole gets hit, you will loose points, and your mole gets hurt. 
Click on it to add the mole to the patients-queue.
Patients will get healed when resting in the bed.

The game ends when all moles are hurt.

The timer below a mole will indicate when it will peek, or retract from a hole.
Hammers will increase in number over time.
